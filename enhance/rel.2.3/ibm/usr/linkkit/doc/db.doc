		      EXPLAINATION of the KERNEL DEBUGGER




	  INTRODUCTION

		  This debugger	was put	together to help in house with
	  kernel changes and particularly difficult problems.  We have
	  no intensions	of turning it into a product or	supporting  it
	  as  a	 product.   We	can  _n_o_t _g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e the accuracy	of the
	  debugger and cannot be responsible for any problems  it  may
	  create.

		  On the positive side,	however, the  kernel  debugger
	  can  be  very	 usefull  for setting break points in order to
	  look at kernel variables at specific	points	in  execution.
	  Also,	if the kernel traps with a fault, the debugger will be
	  entered and there is a better	chance	of  finding  out  what
	  happened by looking around a bit with	the debugger.

		  A major weakness in this debugger is the  fact  that
	  it  does  no	address	validation before attempting accesses.
	  This little problem can cause	a General Protection Fault  if
	  an illegal address is	used in	a debugger command.



	  CONTENT DESCRIPTION

		  This	diskette  contains  files  to  fit  into  your
	  linkkit directory structure.

			  linkkit/cmd/unixsyms/unixsyms
			  linkkit/doc/db.doc
			  linkkit/doc/dbhelp.doc
			  linkkit/db.o


		  The  linkkit/cf/Makefile   will   use	  the	object
	  linkkit/db.o	file  to make a	debug kernel from your linkkit
	  if an	environment variable _D_E_B_U_G_L_I_B  is  set	to  "../db.o".
	  The	_l_i_n_k_k_i_t/_d_o_c/_d_b_h_e_l_p._d_o_c	 file  briefly	describes  the
	  commands that	the debugger understands.
