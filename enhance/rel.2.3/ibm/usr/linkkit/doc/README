This directory contains information for the link kit for 
Microport's System V/AT.  To make a kernel, cd into the linkkit/cf
directory, and type "make wini"; the resulting kernel will be ../system5.

For some technical info on basic driver utilities, etc., check
the directory ./doc; specifically, check the file doc/useage.
Some caveats:
	1)	The serial driver in the current lib2 is set up for two
		IBM serial ports known as /dev/tty0 (COM1:) and
		/dev/tty1 (COM2:).

	2)	You currently need the software development system in order
		to make a kernel.

	3)	This release includes some psuedo drivers to be used
		as examples. They are under the examples directory.
		These examples still need some more work and should
		improved in a later release.
		If you want to learn more about UNIX internals, 
		get a copy of the book "The Design of the UNIX 
		Operating System" by Maurice J. Bach" 
		(Prentice-Hall, 1986). This book has just come out, 
		and has a wealth of information in it.

	4)	This version of the link kit uses config to generate the
		necessary source files from the system configuration files
		"dfile" and "master".

	5)	The "linkkit/cf/Linkkit.mk" description file for the
		make utility uses a loader description file called
		"linkkit/cf/ifile".  This file may not always correctly
		pass information to the loader.  For instance, if the
		kernel requires more than 3 text segments because of adding
		drivers to the  system,  the file "linkkit/cf/ifile.text4"
		must be used in place of the file "linkkit/cf/ifile".
		The "size" and "dump" utilities can be used to find out
		information about the new kernel that your linkkit just
		built.  The "size" utility will tell you how many text,
		data, and bss sections there are in the kernel.
