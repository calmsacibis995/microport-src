PATCH(1)							PATCH(1)

NAME
	patch \- inspect or modify an STL- or COFF-format binary file

SYNOPSIS
	patch [-k] file [-lbisc] [+offset] symbol [datum] [datum]

DESCRIPTION
	Patch displays or modifies parts of an STL or COFF format .o 
or a.out file.
The -k option inspects or modifies /dev/kmem instead of the binary file,
and when used with a kernel binary file (usually /system5)
may be used to hot-patch running operating system.  When used with 
no data arguments, patch simply prints out the contents of symbol or
symbol+offset in the format given by one of -lbisc, which denote
long, byte, integer, string, char.  Integer is the default data size.
When used one or more data arguments,
patch modifies successive locations starting from symbol or symbol+offset
with the given data.  Long, integer, and byte data are numeric and 
may be preceded with a 0 or 0x to denote octal or hexadecimal data.
A numeric address may be used instead of symbol.
Character data may be one character long or in backslash form:
    \123 style strings are collapsed into a single character.
	\000 denotes 0.
	\t gets replaced by a tab
	\n gets replaced by a newline
	\r gets replaced by a carriage return
	\b gets replaced by a backspace
String data may be one or more characters, with the above escape sequences.
A null is always patched after each string datum.
