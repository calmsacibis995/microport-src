	    Keyboard Driver Updates (Release 5.2 - Version 2.2)


1. Expanded keymaps: Each virtual console now has it's own keymap
   via the setkey ioctl/program.  During ths processing of input keys,
   a lookup in the keymap for that virtual console is done. If the
   key is not found, and this is one of the user virtual consoles,
   (/dev/cons1..3), a 2nd lookup is done for the system console (/dev/console).
   This makes the keymap for the system console the default keymap, which
   is initialized in /etc/rc.d/keybrd.rc.  Note that this capability
   will be maintained as much as possible when System 5.3 is released, but
   the default handling of non-mapped keys will probably be changed somewhat.

2. There is a RAW input mode that conforms to the ATT Unix Release 5.3
   specification (with a couple of exceptions).  The specific information
   is:

/* defines for keyboard and display ioctl's */
#define KIOC		('K'<<8)
#define KDGMODE		(KIOC|1)	/* gets adapter mode */
#define KDSMODE		(KIOC|2)	/* sets adapter mode */

   The values for the ioctl argument are:
/*
 * keyboard translation modes
 */
#define	K_RAW		0x00	/* keyboard just sends raw up/down scan codes */
#define	K_XLATE		0x01	/* keyboard translates scan codes to ascii */

   The exceptions mentioned above are:

   A. CTL-ALT-DELETE still traps the reboot code. Note the user program will
      get the scan codes for keys pressed but the last key ("delete") will
      initiate the reboot sequence.
 
   B. ALT-F1, ALT-F2, ALT-F3, ALT-F4 is used to switch virtual consoles and
      as such, the user program receives the "down alt" and "down Fx" code
      but will not receive the corresponding "up" codes unless the user
      uses the ALT-Fx to return to the "RAW" keyboard. Also the Fx up key
      will not be the same as the Fx down key.

   C. SYSREQ also is used to switch virtual consoles and also receives
      a similiar treatment.


   A couple of other notes:

   A. The keyboard driver still maintains the state of the shift keys and
      the keyboard leds. This means that if one virtual console is in
      "RAW" mode and the shift-lock key is depressed, the user program
      receives the "down shift-lock". Now if the user switches to a 
      virtual console in "XLATE" mode, the shift state is maintained and
      input alpha characters are shifted to upper case.  If the shift-lock
      is released, the characters will now be unshifted but the "RAW"
      console does not receive the state change unless the shift-lock
      was pressed will the "RAW" virtual console was "active".  This
      is considered a bug and will change when the full 5.3 keyboard
      driver is implemented.
    
   B. There is no presently available way to set "RAW" mode with a user
      command. The stty "RAW" refers only to the interpretation of the
      ascii keys and does not affect the conversion of scan codes to
      ascii.  This also implies (correctly) that to take advantage of
      the "down" keys (which have the 8th bit set), you must also
      place the tty in "RAW" mode (or at least turn off input processing).
      This is also necessary to prevent the "erase", "kill" (and others)
      from being processed.
