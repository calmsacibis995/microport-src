NAME
	lpinit - initialize the parallel ports

SYNOPSIS
	lpinit [port1 port2 ... portn]

DESCRIPTION
	If a parallel adaptor is found at the specified I/O port(s)
	the port is reinitialized.  (A 0xc is written to the Printer
	control port to select and start it.)  

	This causes any printer connected to the port to be initialized.

EXAMPLE
		lpinit 3bc 378 278
	would initialize the monochrome parallel adaptor, standard 
	parallel adaptor and the alternate parallel adaptor.

	/dev/lp

SEE ALSO
	accept(1M), enable(1), lp(1), lpadmin(1M), lpsched(1M),
	lpstat(1). 

WARNING
	Printer initialization resets the forms control and sets the
	default printer settings.  It is bad practice to initialize
	the printer when the LP scheduler (lpsched) is running or the 
	printer is in use.
