NAME 
     setkey - programmable function keys

SYNOPSIS
     setkey [shift-mod] [shift-mod] ... key 'newstr'
     setkey -p
     setkey -d key

DESCRIPTION
     Setkey programs the following special keys on the system console:

	 center  del   down  end    home   ins   left  minus
	 pgdn    pgup  plus  prtsc  right  tab   up    f1
	 f2      f3    f4    f5     f6     f7    f8    f9
	 f10     f11   f12   f13    f14    f15   f16   f17
	 f18     f19   f20   f21    f22    f23   f24   f25
	 f26     f27   f28   f29    f30   
 
The key 'center' is the '5' key on the numeric keypad. 'Left', 'right', 'up',
and 'down' refer to the arrow keys.  The 'shift-mod' argument may be any
combination of 'shift', 'alt' and 'control' (or 'ctrl') seperated by spaces.
The function keys f11 through f20 are the corresponding f1 through f10 keys
with a shift modifier of 'shift'.  The function keys f21 through f30 are the
corresponding f1 through f10 keys with a shift modifier of 'control'.

The 'newstr' argument is the replacement string to be sent when the
corresponding key combination is pressed. To insert control characters in
the 'newstr' argument, use the '^X' form for control character 'X' (and '^^'
for '^').  If the 'newstr' argument is not present, the current value for
the key is printed (to stdout). If the 'newstr' is a NULL string (ie., ''),
the replacement string is deleted.

The 'setkey -p' command prints the values of all the key settings.  It
inserts the command name as the first argument so you can redirect the
output to a file, edit the file, and execute the file to change the keymap
settings.

The 'setkey -d key' command deletes the the keymap setting for 'key'.  If
'key' is not specified, all the keymap settings are deleted.

'Setkey' by itself prints a help message, with the text of the message
printed on stderr and the list of keys printed on stdout so it can be
redirected to a file.

There are a number of default settings, corresponding to the ANSI sequences,
that are initialized for the system console in the /etc/rc.d/keybrd.rc file
when the system comes up multi-user.  In addition, the setkey affects only
the current virtual console unless it's on the system console, in which case
it's also the default for the other consoles.  This also implies deleting
the keymap on a virtual console (other than the system console) causes the
keymap to revert to the defaults established for the system console.

BUGS:
     There is no way to distinguish the keys f11 through f30 with
their shifted counterparts (ie., f11 is the same as shift f1).  Therefore,
the following (for example) can occur:

     Setting:              setkey f11 'format /dev/rdsk/0s24^M'
     Printing (setkey -p): setkey shift f1 'format /dev/rdsk/0s24^M'
