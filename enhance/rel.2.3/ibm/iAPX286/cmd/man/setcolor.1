SYNOPSIS
	setcolor [[ -bBfF ] color1 ] [ -bBfF ] color2

DESCRIPTION

	Setcolor sets the text mode foreground and background colors 
on the Color, Enhanced, and Professional Graphics Adapters.
	Setcolor -b denotes a dark background color, setcolor -B a 
bright one, -f a dark foreground color, and -F a bright one.
If no options, color1 is assumed to be a dark background color,
