                    in 640x200 mode, y is foreground and x is ignored

    Screen mode settings

    The following are valid with a Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) with a
    Color Display (CD) or composite video monitor.
        ESC[=0h     Mode 0    - 40x25 black & white text.
        ESC[=1h     Mode 1    - 40x25 color text.
        ESC[=2h     Mode 2    - 80x25 black & white text.
        ESC[=3h     Mode 3    - 80x25 16 color text.
        ESC[=4h     Mode 4    - 320x200 4 color graphics.
        ESC[=5h     Mode 5    - 320x200 4 intensity B&W graphics.
        ESC[=6h     Mode 6    - 640x200 2 color graphics.

    Monochrome Display (MD) modes.
        ESC[=7h     Mode 7    - 80x25 black & white text.
        ESC[=11h    Mode F    - 640x350 black & white graphics.
        ESC[=12h    Hercules  - 720x348 black & white graphics.

    Notes:  Mode 7 is the only supported mode on a Monochrome Adapter (MA).
            Mode 7 and Mode F are the only modes supported on an 
            EGA/MA combination.
            Mode 7 and Hercules Mode are the only modes supported on an 
            Hercules/MA combination.

    Modes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and the following are valid with an Enhanced 
    Graphics Adapter (EGA) and a CD.
        ESC[=8h     Mode D    - 320x200 16 color graphics
        ESC[=9h     Mode E    - 640x200 16 color graphics
    
    Modes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6, and the following are valid with an Enhanced 
    Graphics Adapter (EGA) and an Enhanced Display (ED).
        ESC[=10h    Mode 10   - 640x200 64 color graphics

    And last:
        ESC[=h      Switch back to normal text mode.

Configuration:
    The screen driver will use the EGA, CGA or MA, depending on the CMOS 
setting and the EGA switches.  If an EGA is installed, its configuration
switch will be honored.  If both an MA and a CGA are installed, the CMOS
setting (not the motherboard switch)  will be used to determine which is
used.   If only one  adapter is installed,  it is used regardless of the
CMOS  setting.    The  40  column text  mode is not implemented.  To use
Hercules  graphics mode with a Hercules-compatible board,  the user must
run do this command: 'patch /system5 hercules 1' and then re-boot.
