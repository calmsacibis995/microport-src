Welcome to Microport's System V/AT.

Please be sure to read the the Releasenotes that are enclosed
with the diskettes. 

If you have any problems with your installation, contact our
support department at (408) 438-UNIX.

Some Release 2.3 Information:			9/1/87

	1) Shutting down / Rebooting
		Please note that the preferred way to shut down your
		system5 is by pressing the "control/alt/delete" keys
		simultaneously, similar to DOS. If you are an experienced
		unix user, you may have some reservations about this; don't!
		Our file-system hardening prevents any data loss. As extra
		protection, all i/o is flushed out, and mounted filesystems
		are unmounted before the system comes down.
		Of course the standard /etc/shutdown is also supported.

	2) This release contains two versions of the kernel.  The kernel
		on the boot diskette does not have all features enabled
		and several of the internal tables are smaller.  The idea
		is to allow this version to run in systems with less memory.
		The kernel on the utility disk has shared memory support,
		interprocess communication, and semaphores turned on, as
		well as larger internal tables.  It is not recommended to
		run the fully configured kernel with less than 1 Megabyte
		of RAM installed.

	3) Many bugs have been fixed. Please read the Releasenotes that
		came packaged with the diskettes.

	4) The console has been much upgraded for more complete "ansi"
		compatiblity as well as extended support.  Please see
		the man pages for ansi and console.
