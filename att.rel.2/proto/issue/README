COMM vaxfilestore	this shell script takes the file vaxfilestore
			and creates in standard out, a list of differences

			contains

COMMawk1		this is an awkscript used by COMM to generate the
			formatted difference list

CPIO			used by cpio_out to cpio standard and non-standard
			(/usr/.adm) files.  where the file name is preceded
			by '/usr/.adm' this part of the filename is stripped
			off in the header information written by CPIO so that
			normal cpio will plant the file in the right place

awkscript		used by issue to weed out only the files
			needed for the packages.  it will not touch anything
			other than media type o or b, sxt type files or 
			boot package.  The script also constructs the file 
			/etc/mkroom_list which is used by the user
			to remove packages.  Note that files in the base
			package are not included in this file for obvious
			reasons

basecheck		used to validate the BASE file and to update the
			integration release system

cpio_out		used to write the floppies it calls both cpio for
			the headers and CPIO for the files

d			this is the directory which holds the filenames
			to be cpio'd out to the individual floppies

diskdata		this contains the header information for the floppies
			and is generated automatically

filelist		this is used by issue to generate the filesizes

files			this is generated by issue and contains
			the filenames together with package information and
			their filesizes

init_disk		this is used to by issue and makeflops to format the
			floppy disk

issue			this is used to build the issue floppies based
			on /issue/BASE.  it is also responsible for
			making the files of the form /tmp/pslinks
			where ps is the name of the product set.  the pslinks
			file is executed by setup when all files have been
			installed to make the various links as necessary

makeflops		this is used to create the release floppies, if the
			data files have not changed
