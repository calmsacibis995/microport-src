iAPX286 @(#)README	1.1

There are a few files in the iAPX286 directory that depend on the disk
configuration.  All of these files contain a ".20" or a ".40" in the file name.
Before :mkcmd can be used to install all of the defaults for these files,
you must run "make -f .adm.mk disk20" to set up the appropriate files to be
installed on a 20Mb disk system or "make -f .adm.mk disk40" to set up the
appropriate files to be installed on a 40Mb disk system.

If new default hard disks are added for the 286, ".adm.mk" should be modified
to install the appropriate files for the other disks and the files must be
added to the iAPX286 directory.
