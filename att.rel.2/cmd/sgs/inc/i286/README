#/*   @(#)README	1.2 - 85/07/08 */
If you have not already done so, please change your
directory to the directory in which this README file is.
The "make" of the include files consists of copying them
to the appropriate directories.  First, the directory
structure under /usr/b16/include or an alternate directory
must be created.  This step may be omitted for "old"
installations.  Directories are created by issuing:

		make  first

or alternatively,

		make  "INCDIR=/my/include"  first

where "/my/include" is the full pathname of the system directory
in which include files are to be kept.

The include file named "paths.h" contains the name of the
directory "/usr/b16".  If an alternate directory is to be used,
the installer must edit this file and substitute the name
of the directory(s) for all occurances of "/usr/b16/bin",
"/usr/b16/include" and "/usr/b16/lib".
All products which need to know the Basic-16 directory name
(b16ld, b16cc) will obtain it from this include file.

For example:

		ed  paths.h
		1,$s%/usr/b16%/my/direct%
		1,$p
		w
		q


The "paths.h" file also contains the name of the directory
in which temporary files are created.  The default is /usr/tmp.
To use a different directory for temporaries, you must change
the #define for B16TMP.  For example to use /tmp instead:

                ed paths.h
                /B16TMP/
                s?usr/tmp?tmp?p
                w
                q


To install the include files, the installer enters:

		make  install

or alternatively,

		make  "INCDIR=/my/include"  install

This will copy all include files under either "/usr/b16/include"
or "/my/directory/include", respectively.

For "old" installations, the previous version of the include
files can be saved by issuing the command:

                make  save

or alternatively,

                make INCDIR=/my/include  save


After a previous version has been saved by "make save", if
there are bugs in the new version or if problems occur
during "make" or "make install", the previous version may
be restored by

                make  uninstall

or alternatively,

                make INCDIR=/my/include  uninstall
