iAPX286 @(#)README	1.2

To rebuild a kernel on the 310, perform the following steps:
1.	Execute "cd /usr/src/uts/iAPX286/cf".
2.	Edit the appropriate dfile for the system you are going to build.
		(dfile.20w for a system to run on a 20Mb winchester, dfile.40w
		for a system to run on a 40Mb winchester, or dfile.f for a
		system to run on a floppy)
3.	If you made any changes to the dfile, execute "rm current.*".  This
		will cause config to be called to rebuild the needed
		configuration source files.
4.	Execute: "make -f cf.mk VER=ver type [install]".
	Where:	"ver" is the version stamp to be used,
		"type" is "wini20", "wini40", or "flop" to make a kernel to run
			on a 20Mb winchester, 40Mb winchester, or floppy
			respectively, and
		the optional "install" will cause the kernel that is built to
			be copied to /.

*** NOTE WELL!!! ***
The standard kernel configuration does not have the floating point emulator
configured into the system.  If you do not have an 80287 coprocessor and you
intend to use any floating point operations, you must build a kernel that
includes the floating point emulator.  The emulator is specified by adding
the following line to the dfile just before the line specifying the number
of buffers:
	"emul	0	1"

The standard kernel configuration will not allow you to rebuild the kernel in
1/2 Megabyte of main memory because ld(1) will not be able to fit in memory. A
system with the following changes to the dfile can be built on a 1 Megabyte
system and run on a 1/2 Megabyte system so that it can be used to build a
system without a floating point emulator:
	delete the line specifying the driver for "lp", if present
	delete the line specifying the driver for "emul", if present
	delete the line specifying the driver for "sxt", if present
	buffers	32
	inodes	50
	files	50
	clists	75
	mesg	0
	shmem	0
	sema	0
If the emulator is to be included in a kernel being configured on a 1/2
Megabyte system, still more will have to be removed from the kernel being run
to do the configuration.
